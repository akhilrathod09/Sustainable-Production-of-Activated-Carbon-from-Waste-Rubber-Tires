# Sustainable Production of Activated Carbon from Waste Rubber Tires  

## Project Description  
This project focuses on converting waste rubber tires into high-quality activated carbon through a series of thermochemical processes. By tackling the environmental challenges of tire disposal, the study demonstrates an innovative approach to sustainability while producing a valuable industrial resource.

## Objectives  
- Mitigate environmental hazards caused by waste tire accumulation.  
- Develop an efficient and sustainable method for activated carbon production.  
- Optimize process parameters for maximum yield and quality.  

## Methodology  
1. **Collection and Sorting**: Tires were collected from local sources and pre-processed to remove foreign materials.  
2. **Pyrolysis**: Conducted at 850Â°C in an oxygen-free environment to produce char, gas, and pyrolysis oil.  
3. **Carbonization**: The char was heated in a controlled nitrogen environment and subsequently activated using carbon dioxide.  
4. **Chemical Activation**: KOH was used to enhance the surface area and adsorption properties of the carbon.  
5. **Post-Processing**: The resulting product was purified, dried, and tested for industrial applications.  

## Key Results  
- **Mass Balance**: The pyrolysis process achieved a char yield of 59%, with the remaining mass split into pyrolysis oil and gases.  
- **Energy Balance**: A detailed analysis was conducted to calculate energy inputs and outputs, optimizing reactor conditions.  
- **Activated Carbon Quality**: Achieved a surface area enhancement suitable for water purification, gas adsorption, and environmental remediation applications.  

## Skills Applied  
- **Chemical Process Design**: Reactor design, thermochemical modeling, and system optimization.  
- **Sustainability Engineering**: Conversion of waste into valuable resources, promoting circular economy practices.  
- **Technical Tools**: MATLAB, MS Excel, and manual calculations for energy and mass balances.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Chemical Engineering Tools**: Thermochemical Conversion, Carbonization, and Activation Processes.  
- **Data Analysis Tools**: MS Excel for mass and energy balance.  

## Future Scope
